### Reflection Questions

1. **Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**

   Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required a thorough assessment of their web-based software application to identify and address security vulnerabilities. The company wanted me to perform a vulnerability assessment to ensure that their application meets security standards and protects sensitive data from potential threats.

2. **What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**

   I effectively identified potential vulnerabilities in the client’s software using static analysis tools and manual code reviews. Secure coding is crucial as it prevents potential exploits that could lead to data breaches, which could harm a company's reputation and financial standing. Implementing secure coding practices adds significant value by protecting the company’s assets and maintaining customer trust.

3. **Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

   The most challenging part was distinguishing between false positives and actual vulnerabilities. However, this process was also insightful as it taught me the importance of understanding the context of reported vulnerabilities.

4. **How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

   I increased security layers by implementing input validation, using encryption, and configuring secure communication protocols. In the future, I would use a combination of automated tools and manual testing to assess vulnerabilities and employ industry-standard mitigation techniques based on the identified risks.

5. **How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

   I ensured the functionality and security of the application by conducting both unit tests and integration tests after making security improvements. After refactoring, I ran additional static analysis and dynamic testing tools to check for new vulnerabilities.

6. **What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

   Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, SonarQube for static analysis, and practices like code reviews and pair programming were very helpful. These will be valuable in future tasks for maintaining high code quality and security standards.

7. **Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

   I would show this report as evidence of my ability to identify and mitigate software vulnerabilities and my understanding of secure coding practices. It demonstrates my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and commitment to software security.
